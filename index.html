    <section id="about">
      <p>I grew up in a family of musicians, so there was never any doubt that I’d be playing an instrument once I was
        old enough. In 5th grade, I started playing trumpet.
        That was all fine and good, but I would really say my true passion was when I started playing bass in freshman
        year of high school.
        I did School Of Rock, which gave me the chance to experience live performance. It was there that I discovered
        how fun it is to be a part of the process of making a concert.<br><br>

        I’ve had an interest in music production and technology for a while.
        I got into Daft Punk in elementary school,
        which in turn, caused me to seek out more electronic music artists.
        I became interested in how they made their music, and I got a novation launchpad for an 8th grade graduation
        gift.
        I messed around with it a lot, and tried my best to understand how to use Ableton.
        That same year, my parents signed me up for an audio engineering summer camp.
        I got to learn about how to use a full-size console, and basic techniques for recording and editing music. After
        that, I became enamored with recording technology.
        I got a small console, an audio interface, and a cheap mic. I would mess around for hours, not actually making
        anything, but just trying to learn the ins and outs of the devices I had.
        As I got closer and closer to deciding what to do for college, I realized that I wanted to be an audio engineer.
        I wanted to be the one behind the scenes, making the magic happen. It wasn’t until I actually got to college,
        that I realized I wanted to be a live audio engineer. I thrive off the energy of concerts, and I knew I would
        love to make them happen.
        I started working with the on-campus, student run sound company, Nola Sound. It’s a small gig, but I’ve been
        gaining more and more experience, and I hope to continue growing my skills, and eventually make my way through
        the professional world.
